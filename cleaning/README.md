## Merge Brand CSVs

use merge_csv.py to merge csv files for brand products into one csv

brand CSVs should be in one directory (see scrapers README)
```Usage: 
merge_csv.py [options] <directory> <name>

Arguments:
directory directory with csv files
name     output csv file name

Options:
  -h --help           Show this screen.
  ```

## Reef Safety Status

reef_safe.py analyzes a reef safety score for each product

this program's input file is the merged csv output from merge_csv.py

```Usage: 
reef_safe.py [options] <input> <name>

Arguments:
input    input csv file

## Matching Foodland Products & Brand Products

string_matching.py uses the fuzzywuzzy library for fuzzy string matching between the foodland 
sunscreen inventory list and the sunscreen list from brand websites. 

I used token set ratio so that, for example,
"Sun Bum Mineral Lotion Face SPF 30" from Foodland's website and "Mineral SPF 30 Sunscreen Face Lotionâ€“ Sun Bum"
from Sun Bum's website would be matched as the same product. 

```Usage: 
string_matching.py [options] <product> <grocery> <name>

Arguments:
product    product details csv file
grocery     grocery inventory csv file name
name     output csv file name

Options:
  -h --help           Show this screen.
  ```
