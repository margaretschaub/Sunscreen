I used python, MySQL and Tableau to design an interactive Tableau dashboard to investigate sunscreens sold in Hawaii. The purpose of this tool is two-fold: 

Inform consumers of the pricing and availability of sunscreens in each of the reef-safety categories at specific stores

Identify the “best buy” for reef-safe sunscreen

The completed dashboard is available for download: Sunscreen Workbook Download.twbx or online at Tableau public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/margaret.schaub

This  repository contains the programs I used to scrape, clean, and load data to make this visualization. 
I chose to investigate Foodland’s sunscreen inventory since their website offers the ability to shop online and view products available in each store.

CSVs folder contains master CSV files.
